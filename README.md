# Java-RestAPI-PuzzleAndRegistration

I am using MySQL Database with default username and password for registration and login the user and storing in the database.

For sending the verification mail to the user I had used JavaMailSender Lib.

After cloning the project in your system, Please add sender email id and password to get the email verication link and activate the account.

To have a look to the rest api's I have also integrated Swagger-UI
Link : http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

For puzzles - 2 API integrated:
/getQuestion - list of 5 question (random)
/verifyAnswers - will verify the answers submitted by user
